LFPW IMPORT HOWTO
-----------------

First, check below for the needed directory structure.
Second, download the two ".csv" files (kbvt_lfpw_v1_test.csv, kbvt_lfpw_v1_train.csv) 
from "http://www.kbvt.com/LFPW/".

Then, in data/lfpw/ use imgfetcher.py (Python Script) to fetch the images.
The test images are downloaded in the subfolder "test" and
vice-versa the train images in the subfolder "train".
All images names should start either "test" or "train"
followed by 6 digits and the file extention ".jpg", like "test000008.jpg".
Use deleter.py (Python Script) to clean up non-images, such as http responses etc.
Check the images manually for final clean up before importing the data.

Ensure that invalid.txt is in the data/lfpw/ directory. It is a list of images
where we know that these are not valid anymore. The importer needs it.

Finally, import the data with the LFPWImport binary. It has a built in help.

Example:

data/aflw.sqlite
data/lfpw/kbvt_lfpw_v1_test.csv
data/lfpw/kbvt_lfpw_v1_train.csv
data/lfpw/invalid.txt
data/lfpw/test/test000010.jpg
              /test00...
data/lfpw/train/train000013.jpg
               /train00...
