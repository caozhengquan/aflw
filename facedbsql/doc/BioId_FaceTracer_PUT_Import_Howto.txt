BIOID IMPORTER HOWTO
--------------------

First check below for the needed directory structure (see example). 
Second download or copy the bioid data to this directory. It is possible to use a 
different directory structure, but therefore the script import_bioid.sh should be adjusted.
Finally use import_bioid.sh located in the "facedbsql/sample_scripts" folder 
or just run the BioIdImporter binary. 
This importer has a built in help to show what files and directories are needed.

Example: 
data/aflw.sqlite
data/bioid/BioID_0000.eye
          /BioID_...
data/bioid/BioID_0000.pgm
          /BioID_...
data/bioid/bioid_pts/points_20/bioid_0000.pts
                              /bioid_...
							  
							  
PUT IMPORTER HOWTO
------------------

First check below for the needed directory structure (see example). 
Second download or copy the put data to this directory. It is possible to use a 
different directory structure, but import_put.sh script should be adjusted to work properly.
The contours can be ignored, cause they are not used.  
Finally use import_put.sh located in the "facedbsql/sample_scripts" folder 
or just run the PutImporter binary. 
This importer has a built in help to show what files and directories are needed.

Example: 
data/aflw.sqlite
data/put/images/0001/00011001.JPG
               /0.../000...
data/put/landmarks/L001/00011001.yml
                  /L.../000...
data/put/regions/R001/00011001.yml
                /R.../000...
data/put/contours/C001/00011001.yml
                 /C.../000...
							  
											  
FACETRACER IMPORTER HOWTO
-------------------------

First check below for the needed directory structure (see example). 
Second download the facetracer data. Then, in data/facetracer/ use imgfetcher.py 
(Python Script) to fetch the images. Some of these images will be invalid and 
will be automatically ignored by the FacetracerImporter.
Finally use import_facetracer.sh located in the "facedbsql/sample_scripts" folder 
or just run the FacetracerImporter binary. 
This importer has a built in help to show what files and directories are needed.

Example: 
data/aflw.sqlite
data/facetracer/image/000001.jpg
                     /0...
data/facetracer/attributes.txt
data/facetracer/faceindex.txt
data/facetracer/facelabels.txt
data/facetracer/facestats.txt


To clear the entries of an existing database, the argument --clear-sqldb can be set "true". This option 
is available for all three importers.
